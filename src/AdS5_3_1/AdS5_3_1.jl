# always set the number of BLAS threads to 1 upon loading the module. by default
# it uses a bunch of them and we don't want that since they trample over each
# other when solving the nested systems equations. it's much better to thread
# over the loop. see also the discussion here:
# https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/33409
#
# this saves us the tedious task of always setting OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 before
# launching julia.
